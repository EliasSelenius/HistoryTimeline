This project is a knowledgebase of human history and litterature history (or at least the parts we learn at our school)

principle to follow:
- the more knowledge is visualized, the better.


History contains these things:
- Epochs
- Events
- People
- Litterature piece
- Ideaology
- Cultures
- Consequences (an event may be a consequence of another event)
- Reasons (opposite of consequence: an event may be the reason that another event took place)
    - reasons and consequences can be used to visualise a 'event-flow-chart' to see what events lead to other events f.exs (shootings in Sarajevo -> ... -> WWI)
- Subjects e.g: WW1, french revolution etc..
    - every piece of data (event, epoch, person, ideaology, litterature piece) may be linked to a subject. Can be used to filter relevant information
